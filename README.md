## Hi there
My name is Ashya Singh. I work as a Product Manager at Microsoft. 

I am a Feature PM for Microsoft Entra Permissions Management, a cloud infrastructure entitlement management (CIEM) solution that provides comprehensive visibility into permissions assigned to all identities (human and workload), actions, and resources across multi-cloud infrastructures. It detects, right-sizes, and monitors unused and excessive permissions and enables Zero Trust security through least privilege access in Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). 

I have a degree in Computer Science from Boston University.
